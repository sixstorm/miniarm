Mini Version of the Automatic Ripping Machine (ARM)

This is a small attempt to use Bash scripting so that I can easily detect and rip movies (DVD vs Blu-Ray) for my personal media collection using MakeMKV and Handbrake.

## TODO

- [ ] Define folder structure and workflow
- [ ] Auto detection
- [ ] MakeMKV
  - [ ] How to rip via CLI?
  - [ ] Find and rip the main title
- [ ] Handbrake 
  - [ ] Profiles for DVD and Blu-Ray
  - [ ] CLI for Encoding
