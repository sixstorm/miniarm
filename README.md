Mini Version of the [Automatic Ripping Machine (ARM)](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/tree/main).

This is a small attempt to use Bash/Python scripting so that I can easily rip movies (DVD and Blu-Ray) for my personal media collection using MakeMKV and Handbrake in a more consistent, automated way.
